1. What is dot net 
-   Dot net is free, open source, cross platform software development platform developed by Microsoft for building various applications including web, mobile, Desktop and games. 
    It includes tools, languages (like C#), and libraries that allow developers to create secure, high-performance applications that can run on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
    The platform uses a two-stage compilation process, compiling code into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL), which is then executed by the .NET runtime on any compatible machine. 

2. Dot net and it's evolutions:
    Dot net Framework started on 2002 with Introduced ASP.NET for web development, ADO.NET for data access, and Windows Forms for desktop applications.
    Dot net core was Introduced for the support of cross platform and open source as per the demand in the market.
    From Dot net 5 it was named as Dot net instead of dot net framework because now is unified platform inclusinf dot net core, dot net framework and xamrin.
    Now its dot net 9 with more cross platform and cloud support for development.

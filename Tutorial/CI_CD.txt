GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
You can create workflows that run tests whenever you push a change to your repository, or that deploy merged pull requests to production.

Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository. 
A repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks such as:

    Building and testing pull requests
    Deploying your application every time a release is created
    Adding a label whenever a new issue is opened
